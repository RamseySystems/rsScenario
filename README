This is the scenario tool editor created by Ramsey Systems. This is a version of the code which is being merged with the scenario tool viewer.


Current Focus:
- Integration with Frankie's scenario viewer tool
   - UI for patient and scenario base page design
   - Dummy functions for key interactive parts


BUG FIXES:
- timeline pop up isn't flexible (very big readability issue)

- Need to fix that the chosen standards dont align with the one in the JSON









Potential Future Things:
FUNCTIONALITY
- add a catch error when the value of dataPath is empty which means that they need to change it
   - need for them to know something is wrong

- write a little test script for things to test


USABILITY
- move a row around
- insert below

- be able to deal with incorrect dataPath values
